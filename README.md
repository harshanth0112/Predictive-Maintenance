# üîß Predictive Maintenance Using Stacking Model

A machine learning project that predicts equipment failures before they occur using sensor and operational data. This project uses ensemble learning (stacking) to improve classification accuracy across multiple failure types.

## üìå Problem Statement

Predictive maintenance enables proactive repairs of industrial machinery before failure, minimizing unplanned downtime. The goal of this project is to build a high-accuracy classification model that predicts potential machine failures like:

- Tool wear
- Power failure
- Overstrain
- Heat dissipation
- No failure
